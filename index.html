    <div class="introduction">
        <h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>
        <p class="introduction">My name is <b>Fayyaadh Naidoo</b> and I am born and bred in Cape Town. I grew up in the the Crawford area where I attended my community school Alexander Sinton High School and then went on to complete my tertiary studies at the university of the Western Cape. I started to learn programming during my studies as a means of picking up an extra hobby and ended up falling in love with it. It felt like something which had been <i>missing</i> in my life and my only regret was not picking it up sooner. I then decided that this is what I wanna do for the rest of my life as it is something that always challenges you and picks your brain with all the problem solving that it involves. So my next goal in life was to pursue a career in this field. This lead me to <a href="https://www.hyperiondev.com/" target=_blank>HyperionDev</a> where I enrolled in a Full Stack Web Development course in which I hope to improve upon my coding knowledge and hopefully transition into a career in Web Development once I'm done.</p>

    <h2 id="interests">Interests and Hobbies</h2>
    <p class="intandhob">I have a keen interest in most sporting and outdoor activities. Activities of this nature include hiking, camping, rugby, soccer and I’ve even dabbled in some combat sport. Rugby, however, has been a constant throughout my life. Most of my life lessons have been learnt on the rugby field and also many successes. I am currently playing Rugby at Primrose RFC. Other interests I have are paintballing, reading (mostly fantasy books and manga), strategy games and practicing healthy living.</p>
